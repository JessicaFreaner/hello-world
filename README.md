Hi Humans!

I'm Jessica Freaner and I'm an aspiring Data Scientist. I love to tinker and create whether that means taking farmers’ market ingredients and creating something new in the kitchen, making a costume, or breaking out the power tools to work on a new DIY project at home. I get great satisfaction in discovering and thrifting fashion finds. Museums and parks are my ultimate happy places because time in each brings me an incredible sense of calm. I’ve also grown a great affinity to short circuit interval training and relish my time working out at the gym.
